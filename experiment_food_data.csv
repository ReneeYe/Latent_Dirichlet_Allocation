These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.",2.3452707615094163e-05

Of course sugar-free cake is going to be a little different and less rich. But this is way, way worse than other sugar-free baked goods. I have had sugar-free chocolate cake and loved it. THIS mix is terrible. There are many reasons:<br /><br />- The batter is like a mousse, that just gets hard when it bakes. So it looks like crap because it doesn't smooth out as it bakes. Every spoon-mark is still there when you pull it out of the oven. It looks really weird. You could not serve it to company.<br />- The cooking time on the box (for the loaf pan) is ten minutes too long.<br />- There is no ginger taste, or cinnamon, nutmeg, or spice flavour in this ""ginger"" bread. It is flat and tasteless.<br />- The lack of other flavours allows the nasty aftertaste from the Sweet & Low(tm) to bloom with full force.<br />- The gingerbread is lacking in body, because it is as light and fluffy as a mousse. It is not helpful for dieters because it is not satisfying to eat because when you eat it, you feel like you haven't eaten anything. Strangely, this gingerbread mousse is also rubbery. Rubbery stiff mousse that dissolves in your mouth.<br /><br />The overall experience is like biting into a vaguely sweet sponge. Then it dissolves. And then the bitter chemical aftertaste kicks in.<br /><br />I have NO IDEA how a slice of this gingerbread could be 160 calories. There's nothing in it, it tastes nasty, and it is gross to chew on!

Tastes like a Imperial Stout,"This is my second ""coffee-in-a-can"" from illy issimo - my first being the much sweeter <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">Cappuccino</a>.<br /><br />I should preface my review by first saying that I am not a coffee drinker - I usually like my coffee in a dessert setting; being nice and sweet and creamy. I knew enough about coffees to know that the espresso would be the darker, more robust and more bitter of the two drinks, but wow - what a punch. I have been on a beer kick lately and many of the darker stout beers say that they have a strong ""coffee flavor"" which I never understood because I was expecting ""coffee"" as in the flavor I associate with something like coffee iced cream. After drinking this espresso drink, I now understand the flavor they talk about - and oddly enough, the first thought that came to my mind when I drank this was, ""Wow, this tastes like a beer."" (not in the boozy sense, mind you - just the bitter bite and flavor overtones).<br /><br />There is a twinge of sweetness to the drink, but nothing that I would consider having a major impact. The bitterness is pretty impressive considering that this small can has 10g of sugar - to put that into perspective, it has about half the sugar of a normal Coke.<br /><br />Now... the caffeine part.<br /><br />I don't really get much caffeine any more - I used to drink tons when I was a kid - going through multiple six-packs of Coke in a week. Nowadays the only caffeine I get is from iced tea at a restaurant (unsweet). So maybe it's because my tolerance is now a bit lower than it used to be, but this thing kicks like a mule. I drank the espresso about three hours after eating lunch, and I would say that I felt the impact within ten minutes of finishing off the can. It stuck with me for about an hour too. Oddly enough, the cappuccino version of this drink took a few hours for me to feel the caffeine high. I checked out the can and found out why... pregnant women and people with heart issues should probably stay very far away from this drink.<br /><br />Here are some basic caffeine stats from the Mayo Clinic:<br />Drink  Size  Caffeine<br />5-Hour Energy  2 oz. (60 mL)  207 mg<br />Red Bull  8.4 oz (250 mL)  76-80 mg<br />Coca-Cola Classic  12 oz. (355 mL)  30-35 mg<br />Mountain Dew  12 oz. (355 mL)  46-55 mg<br /><br />This little can is 6.8 fl oz (200mL) and contains 155 mg of caffeine.<br /><br />If you're a big coffee drinker who takes a lot of their coffee strong and black, these numbers won't come as much of a shock to you since it's pretty much in line with normal brewed coffee. However, if you're no longer a caffeine junkie, don't be surprised if you suddenly feel the need to run a marathon.<br /><br />My final verdict is that I like this stuff, although in the future I'd probably tend to stick more with the sweeter Mochas and Cappuccinos. If you're not a fan of the bitter coffees, I can't say I'd recommend this drink for you, but I didn't find the flavor as off-putting as many other reviewers seem to have.",2.2533840194512107e-06

But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I'm down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I've always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven't noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).

I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6"">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a>. The first cup of coffee I made with this was very weak. By dropping the bag directly into the coffee and swishing it around tea bag style, I was able to get a stronger flavor. For my second cup, I just cut open the pod, dumped in the grounds and only let it drip until the color started to lighten. That made for a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Marley One Love coffee is an Ethipian Yirgacheffe, which is supposed to be a pretty reputable bean, and it delivers a good coffee. Properly prepared, it is full bodied, with only a slight hint of bitterness - much better than some other highly recommended coffees that I've tried. And the amount of coffee in the packet is just right for a strong standard cup of coffee if you prepare it right - only dripping through until the drip starts to get light. However, it sounds like some people using standard pod coffee makers are getting week coffee and my experience with my first cup indicates the water goes through the pod casing too fast, not giving the grounds a chance to get truly wet so that the water drips through them too quickly and doesn't carry enough of the flavor. So I would say that there's good coffee inside but maybe the delivery process needs work.<br /><br />If you're using a proper pod coffee maker, you're on your own. But if you're looking for something better than the office brew, the contents of the 67 cent pouch are great for using in other single cup setups. 4 stars for the coffee, but 1 star off since it sounds like my roundabout way of making a cup gets better results than the easy way the pod is supposed to provide for.",2.3452707615094163e-05

I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.<br /><br />When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a ""test"" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.<br /><br />So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  ""Icicle compatibility with Windows 7"", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.<br /><br />Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle ""techs"" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us ""technical support"", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.<br /><br />If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.",1.2193337560357022e-05

It claims it is for all types of hair, but that is not the case with mine.<br /><br />Though some have complained regarding the bottle design, I rather like it. To get all the conditioner out of a bottle, I usually have to keep it upside down anyway. This bottle is designed to stand ""upside down"", and consequently, I felt that I was able to use the whole bottle of conditioner.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I do not see any difference in hair health between using this conditoner and the ones I have used before. My hair does not have a marked change. I will grant that I did not use the companion shampoo, but even so, I expected at least a little improvement in the health of my hair.<br /><br />This conditioner is heavily perfumed. I am not usually sensitive to things like perfumes, but every time I used this product, it made my eyes water and itch slightly.<br /><br />It seemed oily to me (though this may be a plus for some people).I prefer creaminess to oiliness. It has an appearance of being creamy, but feels oily.<br /><br />I won't be using this again, mostly due to the heavy perfume/itchy eye issue.

The dried edamame was fine, but I didn't finish it.. there was simply too much of that particular texture and flavor for me to want it all, even though it was a small bag.  The chocolate, as you might expect was a nice treat!<br /><br />My biggest problem with this item is that at the end of eating it (even had I finished the edamame), I just wasn't full.  It is not substantial enough to be a meal.  Also, not that expected differently, but the amount of trash at the end of the meal considering how little food there was is embarrassingly unsustainable.  The plastic fork they included probably should have been compostable-style given the audience this is appealing to, but was not.<br /><br />The box had a sudoku puzzle printed on the inside for those looking for entertainment on the go while they snack, but maybe they should have then included a little golf pencil or something like that.<br /><br />It was good.

There are no guidelines as to what quantity would provide the optimal taste; I suppose that the concept it is ""season to taste"" product.  If you want your beverage to taste more like a weak flavored water, use less--if you want a more pronounced taste use more.  I found in my trials that a few drops are too little, and a squirt can be too much.  I like my drinks to taste like someting, so I've used more.  The sweetness is a bit overpowering; but using less results in a weak drink that I found unpalatable.  I suppose this product is best for those who want tepid tasting flavored water, in that case a few drops would suffice and a bottle would last quite a while.  I found it to be very artificial tasting and not as good as those drink pouches you put in a bottle of water.  The only really good thing about it is that since it is a liquid, it dissolves readily in your bottled water whether the water is room temperature or cold.

I found them, well, different, in terms of snack food. Slightly sweet, but not overly so, with a hint of salt and sesame. These reminded me most of snacking on dry breakfast cereal. The chips/thins themselves are also about the same size as Frosted Flakes-size cereal bites. Not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting, based on the product photos and advertising. I was thinking they would be thinner, based on description, and more chip-like. (Maybe something in the rice cracker family? These are much denser than that.<br /><br />I can see how they'd be tasty on salads as a crouton replacement, though I haven't tried them that way yet, but can't see myself eating them out of hand all that often; though my son asked for more. These are just a little too dry and bland for my tastes and the sweetness, which lingers long after you eat them, kind of threw me off ... And this is from someone who regularly eats organic blue corn flax seed chips, not Lays or Doritos. (Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, taste-wise.)<br /><br />Though you're kidding yourself if you think these are health food, they are definitely a better option than regular chips at 130 calories for a good-sized serving, with only 45 of those calories coming from fat, though the sodium content is pretty high (135 mg/serving).<br /><br />Honestly, I was done after less than half a full serving (which the bag defines as about 46 chips), so these could be a fairly low-cal snack option, IF they fit your flavor profile. Though the marketing boast buzz is all about cocoa and its antioxidant properties, cocoa is at least halfway down the ingredient list, well behind two kinds of rice flour, which is mainly what you're eating here. (Brown rice flour is ingredient number one, followed by sunflower seed butter and I think regular rice flour is No. 3 or 4 on the list.)<br /><br />All in all, just so-so for me, and I don't think I'd go out and buy them again for myself, though they are far from terrible, and I will use the remainder on salads. But, given the flavor profile, if you're someone who likes to snack on dry cereal, you'll probably enjoy them BUT just buying the cereal will likely be a more cost effective, and likely calorie equivalent, option.",2.3452707615094163e-05

When they come out they always have suffered dieback of some of the branches, sometimes a lot depending on the winter.  So, this year, I decided to try giving them the miracle grow for acid loving plants instead of general purpose miracle grow.  It made a huge difference.  I fed them this several times until the foliage came back, and boy did it come back.  They are much more lush and green and as a result have more branches to produce buds.  After which I switched back to general purpose miracle grow.  I decided to try the same procedure on other plants not previously treated this way, such as roses and it produced the same results.  Then of course I switched back to regular rose food.  I even tried it on my tomatoes right after transplanting them from the greenhouse to the ground.

Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

I looked in my freezer to make sure they hadn't leaked without me knowing it and there didn't seem to be an issue. I called the company and made them aware and asked them if they could replace the bags. They were VERY nice, took my address, phone number, and said they'd send me 100 new bags and to return the leaking bags so they could examine them. Sweet!

I use either a coffee press or a Vietnamese filter depending on how much of a hurry I am in.  I have two boxes of Trung Nguyen coffee, which I don't really use.  The coffee is a little bit bitter for my taste.  While the bitterness of Vietnamese coffee is cut by the sweet silkiness of sweetened condensed milk, this coffee bean is still manages to bite.  Fixing the coffee with Cafe DuMond provides a rich experience without the bitterness.<br /><br />I can get Trung Nguyen at an International market near my house.  However, if you buy it online, expect to pay excessive shipping charges.  Before this store opened, I had to pay nearly as much for shipping as the actual coffee.  So a ten dollar box of coffee will set you back another ten for shipping.  Ridiculous.  Be aware of that if you decide to order online.<br /><br />The cost of Trung Nguyen is actually pretty good compared to most other specialty coffees (when you don't have the shipping component).  I can get it at my local market for $6.99.  The online prices normally range right around ten dollars.  Any good coffee brand is going to run around ten dollars per pound.  This brand is just shy of one pound, at fifteen ounces.  The seven dollars I pay locally is a steal.  It is just too bad that the bean bites more than I like.<br /><br />Trung Nguyen is excellent if you like to fix Vietnamese coffee.  I you enjoy a bean that has an extra bitterness, then this is just right for you.  It is a mixture of several beans, which is a by-product of the micro-climates that affect growing in Vietnam.

I've used it in breads and cookies, and in both cases it worked very well. The apple taste works much better when combined with other ingredients.

The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.

I have changed my review to 2 stars and will monitor their so-called ""marketing"" over the next month or two and update my review again then.<br /><br />My wife has been using these bags for the past 3 months or so and like many of the other reviewers, we found them to be a great quality product for the price, handily beating many of the other well reviewed and well known brands on both price and quality. So why the 1 star review? Well we came back to buy an additional 300 after exhausting our supply, only to find the original price we purchased them at ($44.75 for 300) has now been increased to $72.95, a huge difference. This places them at a similar or higher price than many of the other brands. Browsing to their Facebook page, they state that the original price was a temporary promotional price... and that if you sign up for their marketing lists they might give you a 50% coupon that will essentially reduce the price back to where it was originally. A bunch of people are complaining over there as well, expecting to get 50% off the original price of $44.75 for 300.<br /><br />I would usually be ok with this, except the ""temporary"" promotion has been going on since close to the start of the year and they never made any mention of this promotion on Amazon or their website. So to me, it seems like they had just lowered the price to garner a ton of great amazon reviews before raising the price back up again.<br /><br />To new buyers of this product: hopefully this helps you understand why so many of the reviews say this product is great quality for such a cheap price. Don't get me wrong, the product is good, but I'm not sure its better than other brands now given its the same price or more.<br /><br />As of 9/9/2012 here is a price comparison of some of the other highly rated storage bags -<br />Honeysuckle: $72.95 for 300 - 24cents per bag<br />Simplisse: $7.95 for 25 - 31cents per bag<br />NUK/Gerber: $9.16 for 50 - 18cents per bag<br />Lansinoh: $12.79 for 75 (subscribe & save) - 17cent per bag<br /><br />We will be trying the Lansinoh and NUK/Gerber brands out to see if they are good alternatives to Honeysuckle.",1.2193337560357022e-05

For those that believe in taking multi-vitamins, one serving a day is about the equivalent of one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins.  The serving size of ?? floor ounce per 8 ounces of water is about a teaspoon.  The taste was stronger than I was expecting, and the fruit punch flavor tasted more like a tart pink-lemonade to me.  This is similar to Crystal Light, but I found this product to have less of an artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Your mileage may vary as taste is entirely subjective.<br /><br />PROS<br />++ Large bottle brings down the per serving cost of the product<br />++ One serving equal to one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins<br />++ Less artificial sweetener aftertaste than Crystal Light or Mio, at least for me<br />++ Added caffeine and Taurine may give some people an energy boost<br />++ More economical than competing drinks like Mio and Vitamin Water<br /><br />CONS<br />-- Recommended shelf life is only 30 days<br />-- No clear area to see how much is left in the bottle<br />-- Bottle cap made of fragile cheap plastic and could be prone to leaking<br />-- Bottle is too large and requires refrigeration, so it's not ideal for travel<br />-- Still ridiculously expensive when compared to generic multi-vitamin tablets<br /><br />WARNINGS<br />++ Refrigeration recommended after opening<br />++ Not for children!  It says so right on the bottle<br />++ Some are more sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners than others, so try a sample first<br />++ Multivitamins are not for everybody, so consult your physician if necessary<br />++ Too much vitamin intake can be bad, so portion control is necessary<br />++ Contains Taurine which is animal derived<br /><br />The product is not vegan friendly, because it contains Taurine which is animal derived.  Will the added caffeine and Taurine provide an energy boost beyond the product's nutritional content?  Your mileage may vary here as well.  I suspect this will not have a noticeable benefit to those who are used to consuming 40 ounces of coffee per day.  But it may replace the caffeine craving that many people satisfy with sugary sodas.<br /><br />The packaging is large, designed to make 24 portions.  It is re-sealable, and they recommend you refrigerate after opening.  But the cap seems like it is very breakable, particularly for a bottle designed to be stored cap-side down.  The signage is on a plastic label that surrounds the bottle, but there is no clear area to see how much product is left in the bottle.  Even with refrigeration, the recommended shelf life is only 30 days.  So this product will work best for those who have at least one serving daily.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a good product that provides another alternative for those looking for vitamins or a caffeine boost.  The shelf life is not very long.  And the packaging could use some improvement.  But the product itself is better tasting than I expected, and it will definitely appeal to some people.<br /><br />Enjoy.",2.3452707615094163e-05

Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>.

Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well.

The original pots were made in Germany and had a nicely sculptured shape.  Most important was their uniquely designed spout with its small hole that prevented coffee from dripping down the side of the pot when it was poured.  I don't know whether that spout design is patented and often wondered why its simplicity and effectiveness was never copied.<br /><br />The item that I received from Amazon was a very poor Chinese imitation of the original.  I would have returned it but it is not returnable (buyers beware!).  The shape of the pot is clumsy and thicker than the original.  The spout drips when liquid is poured from it.  Detailing of the filter is less refined and it may not work as well.  Even the box with its ersatz Melitta logo is too small for the pot, lending evidence to my assumption that this pot was made in a factory with poor quality control and under the direction of someone who doesn't understand why people valued the design in the first place.<br /><br />Melitta introduced the pot as an inexpensive item with the apparent marketing strategy of using it to sell its filters.  After they stopped producing it, the originals became collector's items.  The one we broke recently was purchased used by my German aunt from a thrift store in Germany to replace one we had lost in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.<br /><br />I would have been satisfied with a good imitation from Amazon, but the one I received was a waste of money.",1.2193337560357022e-05

It doesn't have the doinky texture of gelatin jello and it's much harder to the touch.  I tasted it and didn't notice an exponential increase in the taste of apple juice, and the texture of the agar isn't as good as gelatin jello. It sort of just breaks apart in your mouth like...sand maybe? But at least it's supposedly healthy.<br /><br />So in terms of Barry Farms I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because at least the product worked.  But not going to buy from them again since I don't know if I'll be cheated.  Internets a scary place where merchant reputation is very important.  They should have put more product in the bag to ensure it measures at least 4 oz.  Now their reputation is tarnished.",1.2193337560357022e-05

Included in the box are; Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt, a small jar of mustard, 2 squares of Ghirardelli chocolate, cocoa, cheese straws, wafer crackers, a small bag of chocolate chip cookies, a round of cheese wedges and a small knife. One concern I had was on the cheese. I was unable to track down the company that makes it to ask how long it could last without refrigeration. But I did call a rival cheese company who shared that if unopened some of their cheeses could last a year without refrigeration. So hopefully this is the same.<br /><br />It is really hard to judge the value of a gift basket or box. I have sent flowers that were quite pricey that lost their bloom in a week yet delighted the recipient. Just recently I sent a fruit gift, from a popular fruit company, which included 6-8 pears, 6-8 oranges and 6-8 apples. It was on special but still pricey at around $60. The person on the receiving end was thrilled. With gift baskets there is a tendency to pay much more than the actual value of the items included. And a lot of it has to with presentation. Giving a fruit basket for example, is more exciting than say handing a person a bag of apples from the grocery store with best wishes. And getting one can be so exciting.<br /><br />And that is where the Wine.com basket fails. For ease of transportation, the goodies are packaged in a cardboard box with nutmeg colored paper shavings. This is placed in a larger box to prevent any damage which is nice. However, the red wrap and gold bow are not on the box. It is just a plain cardboard box.<br /><br />The packaging is substantial and fine but it is just not exciting. And presentation means a lot when it comes to gift baskets. So I have to ask myself would I be excited if I were on the receiving end of this gift instead of having received it as a Vine review product and my thought is, ""It's ok"". It is just not exciting.",2.3452707615094163e-05

It is high pH, as in its alkaline water, and it is purified.  On the other hand its municipal tap water, apparently from a variety of municipalities.<br />So, while it is probably good for you, as far as its pH and electrolytes, taste wise it is just OK.  It doesn't have that ""clean"" taste familiar to those who drink spring waters.  Instead it tastes like what it is, tap water.<br /><br />You may indeed notice a ""silky"" taste - it has sodium bicarbonate in it.  That's baking soda to you and me.<br />I am not sure exactly why the sodium bicarbonate is in it, since Essentia advertises that they use electrolysis to split the water into negative (alkaline) and positive (acidic) ions.  It may be that the sodium bicarbonate is meant to support the stabilized pH or aid the electrolytes.<br /><br />Either way, if I want baking soda in my water, I'll add it myself.<br /><br />IThe bottle size is nice, about the equivalent of three ""individual size"" (16.7 ounce) water bottles.  So this is something you can drink over a few hours, or during physical activity to replenish lost fluids.  At the same time, the bottle is not so large as to make it a problem to bring with you.<br /><br />If you are looking for alkaline water, this might be a good purchase for you.

Then the makers cut the size in half and included rice, making the actual curry portion half what it was.

Fair enough - add the rice, but don't cut the curry portion in half to where it is utterly misleading to pass this off as an entree.

I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking ""too much"" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got ""jittery"". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effect energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder).

And, she enjoys meal time.<br /><br />The other thing I like about Fromm is they are an American Company that makes all of their Pet food in America. Nothing is made outside of the USA.  This wasn't always the case, from what I understand, with the canned food. I hear this changed after the pet food scare with food made in China. The Company decided to make all of its food in America. That says a lot. And, to me means a lot.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to all dog lovers.<br /><br />Good ingredients = healthy food = happy dog.<br /><br />All in all a great experience for my dog and for me. Delivery was prompt. The price is fair compared to other sites that offer this brand. Packaging was good.<br /><br />Please be careful when opening the packaging if you are using a knife or a box cutter. You might cut the bag when opening the box. I learned that the hard way....

I love chocolate but find that the sugar overwhelms the chocolate in most bars. Marabou is the exception. A Swede told me that Swedish law prevented their chocolate manufacturers from putting wax in the bars, which accounts in part for their high quality. IKEA used to carry Marabou but dropped it for what I consider to be a far inferior sugary German chocloate which they sell under the IKEA brand. So, the only reliable source for these bars that I have been able to identify is this web site.<br /><br />The 200g Marabou bar for $8.00 is a fair deal, but I can only find it in dark chocolate. I prefer the 250g milk chocolate bar but it seems to have mysteriously disappeared from the chocolate landscape. A few sites list it but when you try to buy the bar, they are always out of stock and do not know if it will ever be available again.<br /><br />Tip: Try melting a Marabou bar in a double boiler with cream and a little butter.

Real strong metallic taste (like what an aluminum pan smells like when it gets the black tarnish on it), especially the after-taste.  I thought it may be because of the lemon juice, so I decided to try another one without lemon juice (since I bought the 4-pack).  It was slightly better (very slight).  Still very metallic tasting and smelling.  Although it was not edible, the texture was very good and the fact that a two-layer cake could be made with one mix was good.  Very disappointed - bought the vanilla cake 4-pack as well and will try that and post results soon.<br /><br />UPDATE...

Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea.

It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.

The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

Unfortunately, upon reading the ingredients label, I noticed that Lea & Perrins uses high fructose corn syrup.  I seriously doubt that HFCS was part of the original recipe.  I know a lot of people say that HFCS is no different than sugar, but I disagree for two reasons.  First, HFCS is made through a chemical process.  Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.<br /><br />Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?<br /><br />Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

Graham,0,0,4,1346284800,convenient source of alkaline water,"This water is based on the premise that many people experience an acid/alkaline imbalance.  In general, the western diet is more acid-producing, and there are issues that arise from a chronically acidic condition.  An approach to being overly acidic is to counter the acidity with alkaline foods.<br /><br />There is one school of thought that says alkaline water can't really change the pH of your cells because your body automatically maintains its own pH balance.  But maintaining a proper pH balance is difficult if you're constantly introducing acidic foods and drinks.<br /><br />Water can be either naturally alkaline or naturally acidic.  Chemically pure water is one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds.  In nature, water dissolves many different substances which give it various tastes, odors and pH values.  Pure water has a pH between 6.81 and 7 depending on the temperature.  Water with a pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and water with a pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline.<br /><br />A pH of 9.5 puts Essentia water somewhere between baking soda and milk of magnesia.  So this water is not just mildly alkaline - it is quite alkaline.  The taste is really quite pure.  I couldn't detect any off-taste or odors.  The water just tasted clean and pure.<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking a bottle or even a case of this water won't magically restore your body to an ideal pH level.  But it will induce your body to potentially counter an acidic state, particularly if you tend to be overly acidic.<br /><br />If you wanted to make your own alkaline water at home, you could do it by getting a good quality distilled water and mixing in a half teaspoon of baking soda.  This will give you water in the 8.5 to 9.0 range.  But I guess the benefit of drinking Essentia is that it's is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis which rids it of chlorine and fluoride.  They also add minerals back in and restructure the water through ionic separation.  What is ionic separation?  In this case it is a process that creates smaller molecular clusters which support more rapid hydration.  But understand that water molecules don't organize unless there is an impurity in the water (hence my suggestion of making your own with distilled water).<br /><br />My verdict:  If you suspect or know you are overly acidic, Essentia could help make your body more alkaline (provided you are not negating the effects by continuing to consume mostly acidic items).  If convenience is what you're after, this water is going to be consistent and it will have a great taste.",2.2533840194512107e-06

I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.

I was a little nervous ordering the half slab here on Amazon for a few reasons: Not Prime, not direct from Amazon, shipping.  Have to say that my purchase was super smooth and that the bacon is (was) excellent!!!  I posted some pictures so check them out if you want the nutrition information from the label or a look at the package.<br /><br />I ordered on a Tuesday and the bacon arrived Thursday afternoon.  Was sent a tracking number right away, and it shipped UPS 2 Day which was included in the price.  As I live in California it was tax free also.  The package was left on my door step in the sun when I arrived home in the afternoon.  It was very warm to the touch and I was worried and dreading what would be inside.  However, when the box was opened the bacon was cold to the touch - though  not frozen.  Just like you would get it from the store.  The outside of the box was wrapped in a heavy shrink wrap, the box was a thick cardboard and sealed with tape well, and inside the box was an inner styrofoam cooler, with a strofoam lid, that fit the dimension of the box perfectly.  Inside the styrofoam cooler were two ice packs and the bacon.  The bacon is shrink wrapped also.  It arrived in perfect condition.  My half slab weighed in at 5.12 lbs.<br /><br />So I have never ""cut"" my own bacon from a slab before.  I used a shaprp Henckel butcher knife and cut slices about 1/4"" thick.  The slicing is a bit of a chore and a bit of a mess as compared to the pre-sliced.  Still the bacon cut easy with the sharp knife and I just used my shrink wrapper to re-package the bacon into 3 smaller packages to put into the freezer.<br /><br />It cooked delicious!  Crisp and slightly crunchy and moist and a bit meaty inside.  Even before cooking the aroma was delicious.  A slight smokey aroma.  Upon cooking over a low heat the smell just ROCKED!!!  Again flavor was great too.  Better then store bought bacon?  Yes!  Worth 4x the cost?  Well that's up to you.  I think so.  Mail order bacon can only be described as a luxury item anyway.<br /><br />I will order from Burgers' Smokehouse again.  Next purchase will be a ham.  Or more bacon.",2.2533840194512107e-06

Neither Tazo or Starbucks actually sells the green tea matcha powder they use to make their Green Tea Latte or Frappuccino. Why would they, if you knew you could make your own at home for considerably less. It has taken me several years now to finally find it, but this is it!!!! It comes with 3 small packs, but well worth it when you can make them in the convenience of your own home. Whether I am in the mood for a hot latte or a cold frappuccino, it is as easy as measuring the matcha green tea powder and adding it to your milk. For lattes, I simply mix it in a plastic bottle with a tight-fitting lid and shake it until it becomes nice and frothy. Then I nuke it for a minute or two and enjoy! For a frappuccino, I simply blend the milk, powder and some ice in a blender.",2.2533840194512107e-06

Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It's suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I'm not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don't care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we've included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins."" Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****",2.2533840194512107e-06

One is baby food and one brand to offer the organic seal of approval is Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1. Intended for babies age 6 months and younger, this food offers infants the same natural food goodness that adults have been enjoying thanks to the organic/green movement.<br /><br />This baby food is loaded with vitamins for an infant's good health and well- being. The product is kosher and the packaging is BPA free. These are all good qualities for a baby food and they are befitting a product promoted as organic and natural.<br /><br />But what about the taste? If a baby won't eat the food, then it makes no difference how healthy it is. Thankfully, babies do like this food. They eat it just as quickly as they do their other food and they have no problem finishing a full package, which isn't necessarily all that large. The texture is smooth and the digestion appears to be easy.<br /><br />One potential issue some may have with this baby food is its expiration. The expiration date is about five to six months in the future and I assume it is due to the all- natural, preservative free composition. This is a much shorter time frame than that of most canned baby foods, so you have to be careful not to purchase so much that your baby cannot consume it before the expiration date.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 is, overall, a very good quality baby food with wholesome ingredients and good nutrition. The cost of about three dollars per container is a tad much, but this is a product of quality and most would agree that price is worth it for the good health of their infant family members.",2.2533840194512107e-06

He is a very large cat, as the vet has a target weight for him at 18 pounds.  Unfortunately, he has been over 20 pounds since I got him.  While he is not fat, he is definitely in need of shedding a couple of pounds.<br /><br />I had always fed him dry cat food.  He was regularly eating Hill's Science Diet when I got him, and I was reluctant to change.  I thought that some of his minor health problems were just a part of having a cat around.  He tended to cough up massive hairballs, he would vomit stomach bile if he wasn't fed for more than a few hours, and his shedding was ridiculously constant.<br /><br />About six months ago, my vet recommended that I switch to canned food in an effor to keep his weight under control.  I quickly went out and bought a bunch of Hills Science Diet canned food, and he didn't like it very much. So I started to do a bit of research on what was the best food available for cats, and I was amazed at what I found.<br /><br />My research led me to Wellness, and I haven't looked back.  My cat has been eating mostly Wellness now for about three months.  No more hairballs.  No more stomach bile.  His shedding has been reduced drastically.  I have also noticed that his litter box doesn't smell nearly as bad, which I assume is the result of him not being chornically dehydrated from the dry food.  I've also noticed that he doesn't strain as hard to pass stool, which I'm sure he'd appreciate if he understood why.  But the most obvious change is my lethargic and overweight cat now jumps and runs around the house like he's lost three years in age, and he has indeed lost three pounds.  He was at the vet's target weight within a month of starting to eat Wellness, and he has maintained that weight for the past two months.<br /><br />The most important question, though, is how does he feel about it?  He loves it.  When I was feeding him Hill's, I would have to clean his bowl every time I fed him because he would leave pieces stuck to the side that would dry out like oatmeal.  With Wellness, he licks his bowl completely clean purring very loudly while he does it.  His favorite flavor is the chicken and salmon, but I can't stand the smell of the seafood.  So he gets his second favorite, chicken and beef.

You have to pour off the broth that comes in the can before adding the egg or salad dressing, and in most brands of sardines, that broth is way too salty to drink. When I read the previous customer review saying that these Reese sardines are no good because they have NO added salt and are therefore ""tasteless"", I realized this was the brand I wanted. I now enjoy drinking the broth, which has just a bit of natural saltiness of the sea, and there is nothing to prevent adding some salt to the remaining sardines; they are delicious when seasoned to your taste.

It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 240 calories, or 60 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Gallopin' Pepper has a spicy-peppery-smoky flavor that is perfectly balanced and not too overpowering.

This is the best toy I've found yet to keep my overly smart dog challenged.<br /><br />I've used Kongs filled with loose kibble, then kibble mixed with yogurt, kibble mixed with cream cheese or peanut butter, then kibble mixed with one of those and frozen. After 2 months of increasingly challenging Kongs, my dog finally graduated to the point that Kongs don't keep her busy or engaged for long. I also had been filling the Premier Waggle with her kibble, and she takes care of those pretty quickly too and seems to have gotten bored of the one repetitive move she used to get food out.<br /><br />So I got the tug-a-jug. My dog figured out how to get food out right away, which was disappointing -- then I realized I could put big chunks of treats in there to make it smell enticing and harder for the smaller food kibbles to come out. It works!<br /><br />I love that you can customize how hard it is for your dog to get food out by putting in objects that are too big to come out. I filled about half the jug with freeze-dried liver. Then, I put about half a cup of kibble per meal. It takes my dog a good half hour to get out all her kibble, and she really seems to love shoving, nosing, and flinging the jug around. She used a greater variety of movements than with the waggle, which is probably more fun for her.<br /><br />I also love that the jug is SO easy to fill! Kongs and even the waggle are annoying because they have small holes you have to shove the treats into, but the entire bottom of the jug screws off so you can just scoop the food in. Fast and easy, and my dog is delighted. Totally worth the $.",2.2533840194512107e-06

Formulated specifically for making iced tea Luzianne delivers a consistent product that is not bitter and has a pleasant aroma.  These days I use one regular tea bag along with one Luzianne decaf tea bag to make our iced tea in this manner:<br /><br />Steep a quart to a quart and a half of water almost to boiling.  You don't want to use boiling water as it will singe the tea and create a bitter flavor.  As long as the heated water is steaming, it's hot enough.  Add 1 family sized (or 2 regular sized bags) of each variety of Luzianne tea (caffeinated and decaffeinated) to the water and allow it to steep all day and come to room temperature.  If you're making sweet tea add the sugar to the bottom of the pitcher before adding any liquid.  Then add about 2 cups of the room temperature (or warm) tea and stir to dissolve all the sugar.  At this point, fill the pitcher with ice.  Pour the brewed tea on top of the ice and stir gently to combine.  Add water as needed to fill your vessel.

Apples have always been her favorite, even when I was still pregnant with her :) This product mixes well with liquids and my baby is able to digest it easily.  We also mix it with her formula and she drinks it out of the bottle. We are very happy this is on the subscribe and save program!",2.2533840194512107e-06
