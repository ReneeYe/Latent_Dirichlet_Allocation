 (CNN)Those of you who are more cynical are probably anticipating another great album.
That's because Taylor Swift, who has been able to spin melodic gold out of heartbreak, is reportedly no longer an item with super producer Calvin Harris.
People was the first to report the split Wednesday. The couple had just celebrated their one-year anniversary in March. 
Neither Swift nor Harris has commented on the current state of their relationship, and good luck reading the social media tea leaves. As of Thursday morning, Swift hadn't tweeted in over a week and Harris' tweets lately have been about music.
But that hasn't stopped the mourning of the Swifties, who had come to love the pair together with their award show PDA and tropical vacations.
Fans expressed sadness at the news that the pop power couple may be over, with a popular refrain being "what happened?" There was also lots of support being offered to the singer in case she is somewhere right now surrounded by her closest friends and a ton of HÃ¤agen-Dazs. 
Naturally, some pointed out that this could mean a new epic album for Swift.
Swift has historically shown she's done great things with a "Blank Space."
