 (CNN)Bob Dylan ain't talkin', just walkin' down this thing called life and today is one of his milestones.
We aren't sure how he is celebrating, but the internet is showing him a bunch of love Tuesday in honor of his 75th birthday.
It seems like only yesterday -- though it was actually more like 16,435 days -- since Peanuts cartoonist Charles Schulz famously celebrated Dylan's 30th birthday. In it, the character of Linus says "Bob Dylan will be thirty years old this month" to which Charlie Brown replies "That's the most depressing thing I've ever heard." 
In Philadelphia, the 10th annual Bob Dylan Birthday Bash will be held Tuesday night with a few dozen acts getting together to perform in celebration of the legendary singer/songwriter. The city of Nashville is the host of Dylan Fest, a two night concert event which raises money for charity. 
Fans are paying homage to Dylan around the world.
Ahead of his birthday, University of Limerick professor Joseph O'Connor penned an open letter for the Irish Times about what the voice of a generation meant to him.

"You took the musics of immigrant America, the ballads, the blues, the rambles of Woody Guthrie and The Clancy Brothers and Dominic Behan, the cadences of gospel, the imagery of William Blake and Bessie Smith, the amphetamine-fuelled poetry of bebop Greenwich Village and the windblown mournfulness of the lonesome prairie, and fired them in the kiln of the most extraordinary single imagination ever to work in popular music," O'Connor wrote.
