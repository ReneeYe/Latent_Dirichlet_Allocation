 (CNN)Erik Bauersfeld, the actor who voiced Adm. Ackbar in the "Star Wars" franchise, died on Sunday at age 93, according to the agency that represented him.
Adm. Ackbar was featured in "Return of the Jedi" in 1983 and again in 2015 in "The Force Awakens." His character, the supreme commander of the Rebel Alliance, led major combat operations against the Galactic Empire. He was best known for the one-liner, "It's a trap."
Bauersfeld died of natural causes at his home in Berkeley, California, according to Coolwaters Productions, which represented him.
"Erik will be deeply missed by his family here at Coolwaters and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends," said Derek Maki, spokesman for Coolwaters Production.
Star Wars fans at Ole Miss tried to get the school to change their mascot to Ackbar in a student vote in 2010. The school's mascot was a rebel before, and Ackbar was the leader of the Rebel Alliance.
Fans poured out support for the late actor on social media.
"RIP Erik Bauersfeld, who gave us Admiral Akbar's voice, and one of the best line readings in voiceover history," posted one user on Twitter. "May the force be with you!"
"Erik Bakersfield, voice of Admiral Akbar has died. Never have so few words meant so much to so many nerds. #itsatrap," posted another person.
