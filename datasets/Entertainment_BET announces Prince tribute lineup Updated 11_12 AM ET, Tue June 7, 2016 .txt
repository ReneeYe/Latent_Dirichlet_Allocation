 (CNN)BET is trying to make good on its promise to show up the Billboard Music Awards' Prince tribute.
On Tuesday, which happens to be the late superstar's birthday, BET tweeted that Sheila E., Janelle Monae, the Roots and D'Angelo are just some of the scheduled performers for the Prince tribute at the June 26 BET Awards.
After Madonna offered up what some fans felt was a lackluster tribute to the late superstar last month at the Billboard event, the network tweeted, "Yeah we saw that. Don't worry. We got you," and featured a purple graphic advertising a Prince tribute at the upcoming BET Awards.

Madonna clapped back by tweeting an old photo of herself captioned, "Wearing the jacket Prince gave me back in the day without permission from BET. lol! God Bless America."
On Tuesday, BET's announcement was greeted with excitement. One person tweeted, "This is reassuring. Can't wait for the BET Awards!"
Prince died April 21 at age 57.
