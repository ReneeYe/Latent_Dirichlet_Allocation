WARNING: This story contains spoilers about season 6 of "Homeland." 
 (CNN)At the end of season 5 it appeared that Rupert Friend's character Quinn was a goner on "Homeland."
But the actor has some good news to share with fans. 
"I hope he enjoys eating through a tube," Friend told Entertainment Weekly about how viewers will find Quinn in season 6.
Alex Gansa, creator and showrunner of the popular Showtime series, spoke recently at the For Your Consideration Emmy panel for the show. Gansa said the new season will be set in New York City, thus bringing Claire Danes' character Carrie Mathison  stateside. 
There also will be some familiar faces next season, Gansa said. 
"There will definitely be some cameos from characters from past seasons. Whether they are the Brody family I'm not going to say, but we are back in the United States," Gansa said. "It's going to be Carrie's first time back in the country for a long period of time in years and she's going to have old acquaintances to reconnect with and establish a new life for herself, so we're going to see some familiar faces."
But there is bad news for fans of Miranda Otto's character Allison Carr.
"Allison is dead," Otto said. "It was dark, but it was a lot of blood."
