New York  (CNN)James Corden belted out some of Broadway's greatest hits in the most epic episode of 'Carpool Karaoke' with 'Hamilton' star Lin-Manuel Miranda Monday night. 
Corden is gearing up to host the 70th annual Tony Awards on June 12. To prepare, the 'Late Late Show' host jams out to 'Hamilton's' opening number with Miranda and it is everything! After driving around for a few minutes they stumble upon fellow Broadway stars, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jane Krakowski and Audra McDonald and then it turns into a full-blown production. 
They kick off with 'Seasons of Love' from 'Rent,' and then segue into 'Jersey Boys' hit 'Can't Take My Eyes Off of You.' Then Corden tells his passengers that he can't let them leave before playing one final song, which happens to be 'One Day More' from 'Les Miserables.'

In between songs, Corden, 37, asked the Tony veterans if they had any advice for him. "People want to have a great time," McDonald tells him. "It's a long evening, so just have fun. Belt out a few show tunes." Ferguson chimes in, "It's the nicest audience you could ever perform for."
This is Corden's first time hosting the Tonys, but it's not his first time on stage. The TV host starred in the London stage production of Alan Bennett's 'The History Boys'  back in 2004. In 2012 he played the lead in the hit comedy, 'One Man, Two Guvnors,' for which he won a Tony Award.
Adding to the excitement this year, Broadway legend Barbra Streisand is returning to the Tonys for the first time in 46 years, where she will be a presenter.
