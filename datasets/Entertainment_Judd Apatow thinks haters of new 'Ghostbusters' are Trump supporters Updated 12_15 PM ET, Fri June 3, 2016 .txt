 (CNN)Director Judd Apatow has an interesting theory about those who have been hating on the "Ghostbusters" reboot with an all-female cast.
In an interview with the news and culture website Uproxx, Apatow said he believes there may be a common demographic between those who take issue with the new film starring Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig and those who are supporting a certain presidential candidate.
"I would assume there's a very large crossover of people who are doubtful 'Ghostbusters' will be great and people excited about the Donald Trump candidacy," said Apatow, who is a producer on "Ghostbusters." "I would assume they are the exact same people."
The project has been the subject of criticism almost since it was first announced.
What we know about the new 'Ghostbusters'
Critics have taken umbrage with everything from remaking the 1984 original (considered a classic) with a female cast to the fact that star Leslie Jones -- the only African-American lead actress in the film -- portrays the only Ghostbuster who is not a scientist.
Apatow praised the movie as being "made by the great Paul Feig and stars the funniest people on Earth." He said he believes too much attention is being given to "just some angry trolls" and predicts that the new "Ghostbusters" will go over well.
"The movie comes out, and it will be great, and people will just be happy to have it," he said. "It's not like anybody really cares about a couple of idiots who hold onto the idea that things never evolve."
The movie is set to be released in July.
