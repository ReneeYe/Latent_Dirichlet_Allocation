 (CNN)If you still haven't been able to score tickets to the hottest show on Broadway, here's a treat for you.
Breakout "Hamilton" star Daveed Diggs assembled a group to rap scenes from a few classic movies and TV shows. 
Diggs, a Tony Award nominee for best featured actor in a musical, and his writing partner Rafael Casal organized some Broadway actors and a few unknowns to remix the dialogue from 12 scenes.
Remixing something historical. Sound familiar?
And just to add an extra layer of awesome, they did it all in one take.
Scenes from "Dancing in the Rain," "Kill Bill," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and "Scandal" are just a few the group gave the treatment to, backed by a live band in "#BARS Mixtape Musical Medley Vol. 1."
It's all a part of #BARS, a workshop Diggs and Casal have in New York that brings together rappers, actors and spoken-word artists. 
"Hamilton" is up for a record-breaking 16 Tony nominations. The ceremony airs at 8 Sunday night on CBS. James Corden will host.
