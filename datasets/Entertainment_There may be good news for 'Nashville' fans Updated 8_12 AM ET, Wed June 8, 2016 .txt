 (CNN)Fans of the canceled ABC TV show "Nashville" are already celebrating.
That's because there are reports the show is nearing a deal to be picked up for a fifth season, with speculation of an announcement Wednesday night at the 2016 CMT Music Awards. 
Entertainment Weekly reported that CMT is nearing a deal to pick up the series, which would be a relief to viewers who were distraught over the fourth season cliffhanger. In it, Juliette Barnes (played by actress Hayden Panettiere) rushed off to reunite with her beloved ex-husband Avery Barkley (actor Jonathan Jackson) and their daughter as her plane went missing.  
'Nashville' series finale gives us hope
A #BringBackNashville campaign was launched, and "Nashies" flocked to petitions to sign their support to get the show on either another network or streaming service. 
Lionsgate Television produces the series, and its chairman and CEO Kevin Beggs appeased some fans after he told The Hollywood Reporter there is an alternative happy ending that would be made available -- even if the show weren't picked up.
