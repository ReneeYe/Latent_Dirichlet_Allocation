 (CNN)Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu tells CNN's Christiane Amanpour that her country is "part of the solution. We are not the problem."
While avoiding any specific comments on Donald Trump, she said: "When you attack this relationship and our community in the United States, when you talk without information about our contribution to the development and growth of the United States, you are wrong -- you ignore the facts, and you open up the space for intolerance, bigotry and violence to spike."
She said that the "Mexican immigrant community in the United States contributes every day with their hard and honest work to the prosperity of the United States."
"In order for the United States to remain competitive and to continue to create better conditions for the American people, it is essential that Mexico and the United States keep working together on building those conditions.
"We are essential for their prosperity as they are for ours."
