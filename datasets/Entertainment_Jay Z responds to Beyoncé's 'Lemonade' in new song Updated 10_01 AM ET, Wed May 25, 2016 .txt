 (CNN)Ever since Beyoncé dropped her visual album "Lemonade" in April, fans have been awaiting Jay Z's side of the story.
On Tuesday night they got it -- sort of.
The rapper appears on the remix of Fat Joe's new song "All the Way Up," which was released Tuesday on Jay Z's streaming service Tidal. 
On the song, Jay Z raps "You know you made it when the fact your marriage made it is worth millions/Lemonade is a popular drink and it still is/Survival of the lit-est/ N****s who really up vs. n****s up in your business."
Umm, ok.
Not exactly the confession fans were seeking in the wake of Beyoncé's album, with songs addressing infidelity, betrayal and heartbreak. That led some to question if the superstar singer was spilling tea about her marriage to the rapper.

Jay Z's freestyle rhymes may remind some of his wife's verses on her "Flawless" remix in 2014. In that song, she appeared to be referencing a now famous incident that same year in which her sister, Solange Knowles, was captured on surveillance video pummeling Jay Z in an elevator at the Standard Hotel in New York City following the Met Gala.

"We escalate, up in this b**ch like elevators," Beyoncé rapped. "Of course sometimes s**t go down when there's a billion dollars on an elevator."

Jay Z also pays homage to the late superstar Prince who, prior to his death, had a deal with the music mogul to stream his music on Tidal.
"Prince left his masters where they safe and sound/We never gonna let the elevator take him down," Jay Z raps.
