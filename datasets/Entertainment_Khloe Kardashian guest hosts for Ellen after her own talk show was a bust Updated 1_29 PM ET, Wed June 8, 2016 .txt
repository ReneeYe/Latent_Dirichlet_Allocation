New York  (CNN)The Kardashians are everywhere -- almost. Daytime TV is one exception, until today. 
Khloe Kardashian will take over 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' Wednesday afternoon for no obvious reason, other than she can.
"There's one famous family I get to see a lot of and that's the Kardashians," Ellen told the audience as she introduced Khloe. "Because I follow Kim on Instagram and sometimes I see more than I really bargained for. You cannot turn on the TV, go online or walk out of your house without seeing one Kardashian."
Ellen is right, the ubiquitous Kardashian family has built a multi-platform media empire. With an astute business strategy helmed by matriarch Kris Jenner, America's reality TV family has stretched their 15 minutes of fame into more than 10 years. They've had five reality TV shows on E!, and a sixth one is in the works. Kim Kardashian dominates social media with her Kimojis. Her mobile game, 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,' has raked in over $100 million dollars since its launch in 2014, according to Glu Mobile. But it doesn't end there, all five Kardashian/Jenner sisters have successful apps and a rabid social media following. Case in point, a photo of Kendall Jenner's hair was the most liked image on Instagram in 2015. 
The Kardashian kingdom is indeed impressive, but they've yet to conquer daytime talk. Jenner hosted her own show, 'Kris' on Fox in 2013, which was canceled after  a six week test run. Khloe has been very vocal about her dream to become the next Oprah, and recently hosted a late night show on FYI, 'Kocktails With Khloe.' But it was pulled after just one season. 
Perhaps Ellen's endorsement is just what Khloe needs?
