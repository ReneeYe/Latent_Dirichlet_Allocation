 (CNN)Jamie Lynn Spears is ready to set the record straight.
The former child star, who in 2007 had to walk away from her blossoming career after getting pregnant at 16, is the subject of a new TLC special.
"Jamie Lynn Spears: When the Lights Go Out" will air on the network June 26. In a promo clip for the special, Spears says she wants to be known as more than just a teen mom and superstar Britney's little sister.
"I'm not just a child star," an emotional Spears says. "And I'm not just someone's sister. And I'm not just a teen mom. For the first time, this is the real story."
Spears, who appeared on Nickelodeon's "Zoey 101," is now a successful country music writer who released an album titled "The Journey" in 2014. That same year she married voice actor Jamie Watson, who is helping to raise her 7-year-old daughter, Maddie.
