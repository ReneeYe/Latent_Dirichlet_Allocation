New York  (CNN)Jon Stewart is back! The former 'Daily Show' star made a cameo on Samantha Bee's 'Full Frontal' on June 6, and it looks like retirement is treating him well. The normally clean-shaven Stewart appeared rested, tanned and seems to have taken a page from David Letterman's playbook by growing a beard.  
Bee made sure to poke fun at the 53-year-old comedian about all the time he has on his hands now that he's no longer hosting his popular Comedy Central show. 
"Just one quick question ... what do I do with this guy?" Samantha asks while pointing to a miniature white pony. "Can you take him to your massage farm?"
"It's not a massage farm," Jon says of the New Jersey farm he opened with his wife, Tracey Stewart, in 2013.
"Because I'm pretty sure you gave up show business to go and professionally massage livestock," Bee ribs. "No, it's a rescue farm," Stewart says laughing. "But it's not a ... no, it's feeding, or water."
Of course, it wouldn't be a Stewart segment without some sort of political reference. "Let me ask you a question," he says to the pony. "You're white ... are you voting for Trump?"
