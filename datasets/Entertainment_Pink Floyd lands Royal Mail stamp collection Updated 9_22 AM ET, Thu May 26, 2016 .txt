 (CNN)Making it onto a national stamp can be a big deal, but given that members of Pink Floyd could in their day stake a claim to anti-establishment credentials, the latest Royal Mail special stamp collection might cause some bemusement. 
The Royal Mail is issuing 10 new stamps on July 7, 2016, celebrating Pink Floyd's remarkable 50-year music career.

The stamps feature light-show moments from the band's live performances, as well as album artwork -- such as the unforgettable "Animals," with Battersea Power Station looming in the background and Algie the inflatable pig floating above it, a reference to George Orwell's "Animal Farm."
This is the first time the Royal Mail has featured Pink Floyd on its stamps, apart from a 2010 issue of Classic Album Covers, which included "The Division Bell," also featured here. 
The other album covers included are "The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn," "Atom Heart Mother," "The Dark Side Of The Moon," "Wish You Were Here," "Animals" and "The Endless River."
A special four-stamp miniature sheet also displays images from Pink Floyd's live performances at the UFO Club in 1966, and from three of the band's tours: 1973's "The Dark Side of the Moon Tour," "The Wall Tour," in 1981, and "The Division Bell Tour," in 1994. 
The new stamps, which like all new issues must be approved by the Queen, can be pre-ordered on May 26 and cost between £6.48 for a stamp set, to £79.99 for a limited-edition, framed "Wish You Were Here" stamp and print.
Pink Floyd is only the second British band to be showcased by a Royal Mail stamp collection; the other is The Beatles, whose album covers were issued in 2007.
