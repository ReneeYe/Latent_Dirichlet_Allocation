WARNING: This story contains spoilers about the series finale of "Nashville." 
 (CNN)"Nashville" please don't be playing with our emotions.
The series ended Wednesday night after four seasons with a cliffhanger that has fans praying it will be picked up by another network or a streaming service.
There was much grief when ABC recently announced it would not be bringing "Nashville" back for season 5 despite the drama having a pretty loyal fan base.
Wednesday night's episode ended with Juliette Barnes (played by actress Hayden Panettiere) rushing off to reunite with her beloved ex-husband Avery Barkley (actor Jonathan Jackson) and their daughter when her plane goes missing.
Viewers did not take it very well.
"If Nashville doesn't get picked up by someone else and that season finale is the end I am going to be so pissed wtf," one fan tweeted. 
Lionsgate Television, the production company behind "Nashville," very smartly used the cliffhanger and the reaction to it to further interest in #BringBackNashville, the online movement to revive the series.
They tweeted: "#Nashies What a cliffhanger! But we won't leave you hanging. There's more story to be told. #BringBackNashville"
That rallying cry has been taken up by plenty of fans who are hoping "Nashville" goes the way of shows like "The Mindy Project" and "Arrested Development," which were canceled but later brought back by streaming services.
There's even a petition to get it renewed for season 5.
The ball is now in your court Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.
