 (CNN)Longtime syndicated American radio personality Doug Banks died Monday.  He was 57.
"It is with a heavy heart we share the news Doug Banks has passed away," his radio station, V103 in Chicago, said on Twitter.  "Our thoughts & prayers are with his family & friends at this time."
No cause of death was announced, but CNN affiliate WLS reported he died from complications of diabetes.
Among those mourning banks was Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
"With the passing of Doug Banks, Chicago has lost one of our most iconic radio voices," his office tweeted.
Banks was born in Philadelphia and raised in Detroit, according his radio station website.  He got his start in radio at his high school station. 
His career took off with gigs in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco, before he settled in Chicago in the 1980s.
A fixture in urban radio for three decades, Banks is often mentioned alongside other format heavyweights like Tom Joyner and Steve Harvey.
Joyner and Banks worked together in the Windy City at WGCI -- Joyner on morning drive and Banks in the afternoon.
"Doug Banks wasn't just my Turntable Brother, he was my other brother!" Joyner said on Instagram. "See you on the other side Doug."
Oscar host and comedian Chris Rock also honored Banks.
"Doug Banks . RIP," Rock said on Twitter. "2016 the year the music died."
