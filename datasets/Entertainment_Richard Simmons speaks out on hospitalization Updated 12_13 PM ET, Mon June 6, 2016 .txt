 (CNN)Richard Simmons wants to assure fans that he is still doing fine.
Amid reports that the fitness guru had been hospitalized for "bizarre behavior," Simmons released a statement saying he was just dehydrated.
"Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and concern after hearing I was in the hospital," Simmons said in a statement obtained by People magazine. "I was dehydrated and needed some fluids and now I am feeling great! Summer is here -- drink plenty of liquids. Big hugs and kisses for caring."
In March, Simmons was the focus of concern after speculation that he had been forced into seclusion.

He said at the time he simply had tired of being in the limelight.
"No one is holding me in my house as a hostage,'' Simmons told "Today's" Savannah Guthrie at the time in a phone interview. "You know I do what I want to do as I've always done, so people should sort of just believe what I have to say because, like, I'm Richard Simmons!"
