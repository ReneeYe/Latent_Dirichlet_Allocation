 (CNN)Viewers of Wednesday's episode of "Jimmy Kimmel Live" saw presidential hopeful Donald Trump, but not scheduled musical guests The Weeknd and rapper Belly.
The rapper was set to perform his song "Might Not" which features singer The Weeknd, for whom he has written several hits.
A rep for Belly confirmed to CNN that the appearance was canceled after he discovered Trump was to be a featured guest on the late night show.
"A strong believer in equal rights for all, Belly is taking a stand against a man who has made many negative and detrimental remarks about minorities, women, various religious groups and more," a press release from Belly's camp stated. "His television debut was meant to support the release of his soon-to-be-released mixtape 'Another Day In Paradise.' Belly hopes that his fans understand his point of view, and he plans to make it up to them very soon."
The rapper is not the first musician to be rubbed the wrong way by Trump.
Recently The Rolling Stones became the latest band to to ask the presidential hopeful to not use their music at his rallies and appearances.

Singer Adele also requested that he not use her songs, and in October 2015 Aerosmith's Steven Tyler sent the Trump camp a cease-and-desist letter regarding the use of his band's song "Dream On."
"I feel like the way I was raised was to be able to see through all the titles in this world — from religion to race," Belly said in a statement. "I just didn't want to feel like I was a part of a celebration for somebody who has beliefs that the majority of us don't agree with."
Trump did not mention the canceled performance during his appearance on the late night show.
