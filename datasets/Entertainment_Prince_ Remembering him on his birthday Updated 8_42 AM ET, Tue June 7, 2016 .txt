 (CNN)Tuesday was supposed to be a day of celebration for Prince fans.
But with an ongoing investigation into the death of the pop icon, the stage has also been set for it to be a day of mourning. 
The star, who died on April 21 at age 57, was remembered on social media, radio stations and around the world with more than a few wishing he was still here to share in the accolades.
The Saturday before Prince's birthday, director Spike Lee threw a party in Brooklyn in honor of his friend. There was plenty of dancing, performances and celeb sightings. Naturally the color theme was purple.
As a Jehovah Witness, Prince didn't celebrate his birthday, but that hasn't dissuaded folks from planning events around the world for his special day. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton even declared the day "Prince Day."
In Minneapolis, a screening of the "Sign 'O' the Times" movie at WXYZ Bar at Aloft will be followed by a dance party. In Dublin, Ireland a tribute band will rock out for an event being billed as "Prince's 58th Birthday Celebration.
