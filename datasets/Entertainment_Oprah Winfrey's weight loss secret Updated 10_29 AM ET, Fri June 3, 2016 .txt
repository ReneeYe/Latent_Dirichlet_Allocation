 (CNN)Oprah Winfrey has a new secret weapon when it comes to the weight loss battle.
Winfrey has lost 30 pounds and reportedly recently told a few fellow Weight Watchers members that having a weight loss buddy has made all the difference.
According to ABC, Winfrey hopped on a call with six fellow members (with "Good Morning America" listening in) to swap tips and inspiration. She told the group that life partner Stedman Graham has also become her Weight Watchers partner.
"He kept asking me what every point was, and I said, 'Why don't you just join?'" she reportedly said during the call. "For me, it's so much better when other people are also counting points."
In October 2015, Winfrey invested in the weight loss company and has been advertising for them.
