       " 'I was really excited about getting this tea. I have been attempting to eliminate bad foods and drinks from my diet so I thought this would be a good way to curb my chocolate cravings. The best thing about this tea is how it smells, it really is amazing. The flavor however is not so amazing. I do not know how someone could drink this without any kind of sweetener or milk added because it really does have a bitter taste. I added some sugar substitute to my tea as well as a small dollop of whipped cream. I enjoyed the taste of it after some doctoring but overall I do not think it is worth the nearly 15$ price tag. I am a fan of very dark chocolate but I had trouble with this. It seems very strong and likely to induce a stomach ache if one is not careful. I will have to be in a very specific mood to drink this again.',\n",
       " \"Look, its salty and creamy and on a sandwich esp a BLT it will perk it up but taste it on its own and meh.  I love the spirit of the company after going to their website and appreciate the effort in making this vegan but I think as a product it would be much better with some eggs and real bacon flavor in there, imho.  I have a regular jar of mayo here and I just added some cooled bacon fat and some bacon crumbles and its way better even if its not shelf stable and therein for me lies the problem.  If you have the time to make real bacon once a week and mix it with some mayo, its way better.  If you don't and you like the idea well, here it is.<br /><br />To reiterate, this is a brilliant concept but unless I was a vegan I would just DIY.\",\n",

The gum was small; had to chew two to get the same size feel as National brand sugarless gums.

       " 'I don\\'t know that there is anything about Essentia\\'s taste that will wow you.  It is high pH, as in its alkaline water, and it is purified.  On the other hand its municipal tap water, apparently from a variety of municipalities.<br />So, while it is probably good for you, as far as its pH and electrolytes, taste wise it is just OK.  It doesn\\'t have that \"clean\" taste familiar to those who drink spring waters.  Instead it tastes like what it is, tap water.<br /><br />You may indeed notice a \"silky\" taste - it has sodium bicarbonate in it.  That\\'s baking soda to you and me.<br />I am not sure exactly why the sodium bicarbonate is in it, since Essentia advertises that they use electrolysis to split the water into negative (alkaline) and positive (acidic) ions.  It may be that the sodium bicarbonate is meant to support the stabilized pH or aid the electrolytes.<br /><br />Either way, if I want baking soda in my water, I\\'ll add it myself.<br /><br />IThe bottle size is nice, about the equivalent of three \"individual size\" (16.7 ounce) water bottles.  So this is something you can drink over a few hours, or during physical activity to replenish lost fluids.  At the same time, the bottle is not so large as to make it a problem to bring with you.<br /><br />If you are looking for alkaline water, this might be a good purchase for you.  If you are buying water purely for superior taste, this isn\\'t anything special.<br /><br />Overall, it is what it is advertised to be.  I am a little put off by the baking soda content, but other than that, it\\'s OK.',\n",

And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness.

I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.<br /><br />After trying the original - I could not agree more. What an excellent hot sauce.<br /><br />Then - I tried the other Cholula varieties. This company also offers a lime, garlic and chipotle versions. All of these were a major disappointment.<br /><br />Their Chipotle based hot sauce lacks almost any flavor beyond a heavy dose of vinegar along with a bit of gentle heat. At best - there is just a hint of this smoked (Chipotle) pepper.<br /><br />Far better (for a Chipotle based hot sauce) are either the Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce or the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. Both of these are excellent and have a rich Chipotle favor and far surpass the Cholula Chipotle.<br /><br />Make no mistake - the original Cholula is excellent but the variants of their original hot sauce fall far short of the original.<br /><br />Everyone needs a hobby and I've been blind taste testing about 40 different hot sauces for over 6 months. I stumbled on Scott Roberts review long after I had determined that the Cholula Original was an excellent hot sauce from my point of view.

I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don\\'t have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking \"too much\" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got \"jittery\". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effect energy drink but it isn\\'t as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder).

She was on Science Diet when I first adopted her and a friend of mine who also has an APBT was telling me her dog had a beef allergy and that her vet told her that this was an issue in some ABPT. That is how she found Fromm. She made the switch and her dog looks great.<br /><br />I had never ordered dog food online before but I was willing to try anything to help my sweet furry pal out.<br /><br />I am glad I did.<br /><br />I was going to slowly introduce this to her diet. Wean her off Science diet and switch her on Fromm.<br /><br />She wanted none of that. She LOVES the Wisconsin duck and sweet potato. The day I opened the bag she wanted to eat from it and would not go near the Science Diet. (I don't recommend a cold switch but her actions really did show loud). Not only did she not have any noticeable upset from the sudden change in diet. She started to perk up in a way. I had not seen before. Her skin issues started to go away. Her eyes cleared up. And, she enjoys meal time.<br /><br />The other thing I like about Fromm is they are an American Company that makes all of their Pet food in America. Nothing is made outside of the USA.  This wasn't always the case, from what I understand, with the canned food. I hear this changed after the pet food scare with food made in China. The Company decided to make all of its food in America. That says a lot.

And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.

The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.

My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield.

       " \"I have a seven year old gray tabby named Buddy.  I got him when he was three.  He is a very large cat, as the vet has a target weight for him at 18 pounds.  Unfortunately, he has been over 20 pounds since I got him.  While he is not fat, he is definitely in need of shedding a couple of pounds.<br /><br />I had always fed him dry cat food.  He was regularly eating Hill's Science Diet when I got him, and I was reluctant to change.  I thought that some of his minor health problems were just a part of having a cat around.  He tended to cough up massive hairballs, he would vomit stomach bile if he wasn't fed for more than a few hours, and his shedding was ridiculously constant.<br /><br />About six months ago, my vet recommended that I switch to canned food in an effor to keep his weight under control.  I quickly went out and bought a bunch of Hills Science Diet canned food, and he didn't like it very much. So I started to do a bit of research on what was the best food available for cats, and I was amazed at what I found.<br /><br />My research led me to Wellness, and I haven't looked back.  My cat has been eating mostly Wellness now for about three months.  No more hairballs.  No more stomach bile.  His shedding has been reduced drastically.  I have also noticed that his litter box doesn't smell nearly as bad, which I assume is the result of him not being chornically dehydrated from the dry food.  I've also noticed that he doesn't strain as hard to pass stool, which I'm sure he'd appreciate if he understood why.  But the most obvious change is my lethargic and overweight cat now jumps and runs around the house like he's lost three years in age, and he has indeed lost three pounds.  He was at the vet's target weight within a month of starting to eat Wellness, and he has maintained that weight for the past two months.<br /><br />The most important question, though, is how does he feel about it?  He loves it.  When I was feeding him Hill's, I would have to clean his bowl every time I fed him because he would leave pieces stuck to the side that would dry out like oatmeal.  With Wellness, he licks his bowl completely clean purring very loudly while he does it.  His favorite flavor is the chicken and salmon, but I can't stand the smell of the seafood.  So he gets his second favorite, chicken and beef.  He's not a big fan of the poultry only flavors, but he still likes them better than the Hill's he used to have to eat.<br /><br />A few days ago, I actually ran out of Wellness, and I fed him a can of Hill's to get by for the night until I could go buy more.  At 5:00 AM, I would up to the sound of my cat puking up stomach bile.<br /><br />From now on, it's Wellness or nothing.\",\n",

This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed.

It appears from the Izze web site that Izze in 12 oz bottles is not fortified so I might one day want to try the non-fortified Izze and see what that is like.<br /><br />However, the 100% sparkling grape juice I can buy locally, although it comes in a much larger bottle so may not be as convenient, seems more economical so, if I wanted a sparking juice, I'd probably buy that instead.

Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.\",\n",

       " \"We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.

       " \"These reasonably healthy snacks got a thumbs up from my husband and four-year-old. I found them, well, different, in terms of snack food. Slightly sweet, but not overly so, with a hint of salt and sesame. These reminded me most of snacking on dry breakfast cereal. The chips/thins themselves are also about the same size as Frosted Flakes-size cereal bites. Not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting, based on the product photos and advertising. I was thinking they would be thinner, based on description, and more chip-like. (Maybe something in the rice cracker family? These are much denser than that.<br /><br />I can see how they'd be tasty on salads as a crouton replacement, though I haven't tried them that way yet, but can't see myself eating them out of hand all that often; though my son asked for more. These are just a little too dry and bland for my tastes and the sweetness, which lingers long after you eat them, kind of threw me off ... And this is from someone who regularly eats organic blue corn flax seed chips, not Lays or Doritos. (Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, taste-wise.)<br /><br />Though you're kidding yourself if you think these are health food, they are definitely a better option than regular chips at 130 calories for a good-sized serving, with only 45 of those calories coming from fat, though the sodium content is pretty high (135 mg/serving).<br /><br />Honestly, I was done after less than half a full serving (which the bag defines as about 46 chips), so these could be a fairly low-cal snack option, IF they fit your flavor profile. Though the marketing boast buzz is all about cocoa and its antioxidant properties, cocoa is at least halfway down the ingredient list, well behind two kinds of rice flour, which is mainly what you're eating here. (Brown rice flour is ingredient number one, followed by sunflower seed butter and I think regular rice flour is No. 3 or 4 on the list.)<br /><br />All in all, just so-so for me, and I don't think I'd go out and buy them again for myself, though they are far from terrible, and I will use the remainder on salads. But, given the flavor profile, if you're someone who likes to snack on dry cereal, you'll probably enjoy them BUT just buying the cereal will likely be a more cost effective, and likely calorie equivalent, option.\",\n",

I really wish that I had tried one first (such as buy a single bar from a local store/health food shop), because If I had, there's no way I would have bought an entire box.

I really don't have a problem with sweet as I do have a sweet tongue, but these are just sickly and leave both your mouth and fingers icky-sticky. The other thing that annoys me is that they make it clear on the packaging that these are Flax seed bars, but you'll have noticed in the list of ingredients that flax seeds come way down the list in terms of quantity. Before you order a six pack of six, I'd be inclined to try one bar first, and then decide whether these are to your liking or not.\",\n",

I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I\\'m not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don\\'t care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we\\'ve included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins.\" Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****',\n",

The berries are whole or in halves, the color is true and the fluid part is completely smooth, rich and has a dense texture.  The flavor is strong enough to stand up to the density and full flavor of a biscuit, but it's also great on bagels or english muffins or toast.

Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.\",\n",

I thought it might be my scale so I weighed my mineral makeup that came on the same day, 1.3 pounds each for a 1 pound bag.  So Barry Farm only shipped me 3 oz of product when I payed for 4 oz, which doesn't seem like a lot but when you do the calculations it's quite a dent.<br /><br />Let me compare this to the other agar option on Amazon by NOW Foods.<br /><br />Barry Farm (3 oz) $7.90 + $7.13 (Shipping) =  $15.03 (Comes in a plastic Ziploc bag)<br /><br />NOW Foods (2 oz) $4.20 + $5.38 (Shipping) = $9.58/2 = $4.79/oz * 3 = $14.37 for 3 oz (Comes in a plastic bottle)<br /><br />NOW Foods (32 oz) $40.79 + $7.55) = $48.34/32 = $1.51/oz *3 = $4.53<br /><br />So including shipping,<br /><br />Barry Farm $15.03/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $14.37/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $ 4.53/3 oz<br /><br />With a bottle instead of a plastic bag, my future purchases would be from NOW Foods.  I'm so tempted to get the 2 Pound bottle since an ounce is only $1.51 that way, but agar's gelling quality is so good that it gets used very slowly.<br /><br />Now about the agar.  I cooked it last night (1 Cup apple juice to 1/2 teaspoon powder), and left it in the fridge.  This morning I woke up to see it gelled quite nicely.  It doesn't have the doinky texture of gelatin jello and it's much harder to the touch.  I tasted it and didn't notice an exponential increase in the taste of apple juice, and the texture of the agar isn't as good as gelatin jello. It sort of just breaks apart in your mouth like...sand maybe? But at least it's supposedly healthy.<br /><br />So in terms of Barry Farms I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because at least the product worked.

I also am a devoted lover of geraniums and I like to have them growing in hanging pots. But they will not withstand the winters here, so I winter them over in the greenhouse and bring them out when they are safe from frost. When they come out they always have suffered dieback of some of the branches, sometimes a lot depending on the winter.  So, this year, I decided to try giving them the miracle grow for acid loving plants instead of general purpose miracle grow.  It made a huge difference.  I fed them this several times until the foliage came back, and boy did it come back.  They are much more lush and green and as a result have more branches to produce buds.  After which I switched back to general purpose miracle grow.  I decided to try the same procedure on other plants not previously treated this way, such as roses and it produced the same results.  Then of course I switched back to regular rose food.  I even tried it on my tomatoes right after transplanting them from the greenhouse to the ground.  It gave them a boost during the transition from greenhouse to outdoors, without trying to get them to produce blooms.  It has been a boon to my tomatoes.  They made the transition seamlessly.',\n",

But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I\\'m down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I\\'ve always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven\\'t noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).

This brand is just shy of one pound, at fifteen ounces.  The seven dollars I pay locally is a steal.  It is just too bad that the bean bites more than I like.<br /><br />Trung Nguyen is excellent if you like to fix Vietnamese coffee.  I you enjoy a bean that has an extra bitterness, then this is just right for you.  It is a mixture of several beans, which is a by-product of the micro-climates that affect growing in Vietnam.

Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds \"single serve pods\" it does not specify that they\\'re pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here\\'s the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don\\'t really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don\\'t own a pod coffee maker.  I don\\'t like them very much.  I\\'m going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said \"teabagging\" with these things doesn\\'t work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn\\'t strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it\\'s 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: \"This side down\"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it\\'s a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it\\'s kind of pricey.  I don\\'t honestly think that I\\'d change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

       " \"Going organic is all the rage and organic versions of our favorite foods continue to appear in places we may not expect. One is baby food and one brand to offer the organic seal of approval is Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1. Intended for babies age 6 months and younger, this food offers infants the same natural food goodness that adults have been enjoying thanks to the organic/green movement.<br /><br />This baby food is loaded with vitamins for an infant's good health and well- being. The product is kosher and the packaging is BPA free. These are all good qualities for a baby food and they are befitting a product promoted as organic and natural.<br /><br />But what about the taste? If a baby won't eat the food, then it makes no difference how healthy it is. Thankfully, babies do like this food. They eat it just as quickly as they do their other food and they have no problem finishing a full package, which isn't necessarily all that large. The texture is smooth and the digestion appears to be easy.<br /><br />One potential issue some may have with this baby food is its expiration. The expiration date is about five to six months in the future and I assume it is due to the all- natural, preservative free composition. This is a much shorter time frame than that of most canned baby foods, so you have to be careful not to purchase so much that your baby cannot consume it before the expiration date.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 is, overall, a very good quality baby food with wholesome ingredients and good nutrition. The cost of about three dollars per container is a tad much, but this is a product of quality and most would agree that price is worth it for the good health of their infant family members.\",\n",

       " 'This is my second \"coffee-in-a-can\" from illy issimo - my first being the much sweeter <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY\">Cappuccino</a>.<br /><br />I should preface my review by first saying that I am not a coffee drinker - I usually like my coffee in a dessert setting; being nice and sweet and creamy. I knew enough about coffees to know that the espresso would be the darker, more robust and more bitter of the two drinks, but wow - what a punch. I have been on a beer kick lately and many of the darker stout beers say that they have a strong \"coffee flavor\" which I never understood because I was expecting \"coffee\" as in the flavor I associate with something like coffee iced cream. After drinking this espresso drink, I now understand the flavor they talk about - and oddly enough, the first thought that came to my mind when I drank this was, \"Wow, this tastes like a beer.\" (not in the boozy sense, mind you - just the bitter bite and flavor overtones).<br /><br />There is a twinge of sweetness to the drink, but nothing that I would consider having a major impact. The bitterness is pretty impressive considering that this small can has 10g of sugar - to put that into perspective, it has about half the sugar of a normal Coke.<br /><br />Now... the caffeine part.<br /><br />I don\\'t really get much caffeine any more - I used to drink tons when I was a kid - going through multiple six-packs of Coke in a week. Nowadays the only caffeine I get is from iced tea at a restaurant (unsweet). So maybe it\\'s because my tolerance is now a bit lower than it used to be, but this thing kicks like a mule. I drank the espresso about three hours after eating lunch, and I would say that I felt the impact within ten minutes of finishing off the can. It stuck with me for about an hour too. Oddly enough, the cappuccino version of this drink took a few hours for me to feel the caffeine high. I checked out the can and found out why... pregnant women and people with heart issues should probably stay very far away from this drink.<br /><br />Here are some basic caffeine stats from the Mayo Clinic:<br />Drink  Size  Caffeine<br />5-Hour Energy  2 oz. (60 mL)  207 mg<br />Red Bull  8.4 oz (250 mL)  76-80 mg<br />Coca-Cola Classic  12 oz. (355 mL)  30-35 mg<br />Mountain Dew  12 oz. (355 mL)  46-55 mg<br /><br />This little can is 6.8 fl oz (200mL) and contains 155 mg of caffeine.<br /><br />If you\\'re a big coffee drinker who takes a lot of their coffee strong and black, these numbers won\\'t come as much of a shock to you since it\\'s pretty much in line with normal brewed coffee. However, if you\\'re no longer a caffeine junkie, don\\'t be surprised if you suddenly feel the need to run a marathon.<br /><br />My final verdict is that I like this stuff, although in the future I\\'d probably tend to stick more with the sweeter Mochas and Cappuccinos. If you\\'re not a fan of the bitter coffees, I can\\'t say I\\'d recommend this drink for you, but I didn\\'t find the flavor as off-putting as many other reviewers seem to have.',\n",

These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.\",\n",

There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)\",\n",
       " \"Nice caramel apple flavor (its an artificially sweetened powder that completely dissolves and empties out of the k-cup). This can have a somewhat strong/tart flavor on small cup setting, so i run the same k-cup twice on 'small' cup setting in a large mug to dilute it slightly more to suit my taste.  Quick and convenient hot apple cider with caramel touch for those occasions when you crave apple cider, hot or cold  add ice cubes).<br /><br />***update*** noticed my keurig was spurting during brew cycle but only when using this caramel apple cider k-cup.  After making a cup of cider, i decided to cut the foil open on the top of the k-cup.  I discovered this stuff clumps during brewing inside the bottom of the cup as a sticky ball.  It has done it on the second pack as well, so might be product & not just a bad batch. Might be clogging up the discharge needle in the bottom of the k-cup.  Just to check out what's inside, I cut open a new cup and small amuont of brown and white powder is all there is to this.\",\n",
       " \"I love the Yogi brand of Chai tea...whether it's the Redbush or Green tea.  It has so much more flavor than other brands of Chai tea and I have tried a ton of varieties.  I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.\",\n",

       " \"San Francisco Bay 'Fog Chaser' is true to it's name. It will definitely lift the morning fog and get you going. It's a very strong brew, but isn't harsh. You will not question whether you have had a cup of coffee though. You will know.<br /><br />I like it so well that I've got it on a subscription.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this product for chocolate milk.  I found it neither better, nor worse than any old store-brand chocolate syrup.  It's perfectly acceptable but not worth the huge online markup.  I think a lot of regional nostalgia is driving the raving 5 star reviews.\",\n",
       " \"This water is based on the premise that many people experience an acid/alkaline imbalance.  In general, the western diet is more acid-producing, and there are issues that arise from a chronically acidic condition.  An approach to being overly acidic is to counter the acidity with alkaline foods.<br /><br />There is one school of thought that says alkaline water can't really change the pH of your cells because your body automatically maintains its own pH balance.  But maintaining a proper pH balance is difficult if you're constantly introducing acidic foods and drinks.<br /><br />Water can be either naturally alkaline or naturally acidic.  Chemically pure water is one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds.  In nature, water dissolves many different substances which give it various tastes, odors and pH values.  Pure water has a pH between 6.81 and 7 depending on the temperature.  Water with a pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and water with a pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline.<br /><br />A pH of 9.5 puts Essentia water somewhere between baking soda and milk of magnesia.  So this water is not just mildly alkaline - it is quite alkaline.  The taste is really quite pure.  I couldn't detect any off-taste or odors.  The water just tasted clean and pure.<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking a bottle or even a case of this water won't magically restore your body to an ideal pH level.  But it will induce your body to potentially counter an acidic state, particularly if you tend to be overly acidic.<br /><br />If you wanted to make your own alkaline water at home, you could do it by getting a good quality distilled water and mixing in a half teaspoon of baking soda.  This will give you water in the 8.5 to 9.0 range.  But I guess the benefit of drinking Essentia is that it's is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis which rids it of chlorine and fluoride.  They also add minerals back in and restructure the water through ionic separation.  What is ionic separation?  In this case it is a process that creates smaller molecular clusters which support more rapid hydration.  But understand that water molecules don't organize unless there is an impurity in the water (hence my suggestion of making your own with distilled water).<br /><br />My verdict:  If you suspect or know you are overly acidic, Essentia could help make your body more alkaline (provided you are not negating the effects by continuing to consume mostly acidic items).  If convenience is what you're after, this water is going to be consistent and it will have a great taste.\",\n",
